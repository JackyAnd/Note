英语五种基本句型结构
英语中的五种基本句型结构
一、句型1: Subject(主语) + Verb(谓语)
这种句型中的动词大多是不及物动词,所谓不及物动词,就是这种动词后不可以直接接宾语。
常见的动词如:Work,sing, swim,fish,jump, arrive,come,die, disappear, cry,happen等,如：
1) Li Ming works very hard.李明学习很努力
2) The accident happened yesterday afternoon.事故是昨天下午发生的
3) Spring is coming.
4) We have lived in the city for ten years.

二、句型2: Subject(主语) + Link.V(系动词) + Predicate(表语)
这种句型主要用来表示主语的特点、身份等。其系动词一般可分为下列两类：
(1)表示状态。这样的词有:be,look,seem,smell, taste, sound,keep等，如：
    1) This kind of food tastes delicious.这种食物吃起来很可口
    2) He looked worried just now.刚才他看上去有些焦急
(2)表示变化，这类系动词有:become,turn,get,grow,go 等，如：
    1) Spring comes. It is getting warmer and warmer.春天到了,天气变得越来越暖和。
    2) The tree has grown much taller than before.棵树比以前长得高多。

三、句型3: Subject(主语) + Verb(谓语) + Object(宾语)
这种句型中的动词一般为及物动词,所谓及物动词,就是这种动词后可以直接接宾语,其宾语通常由名词、代词、动词不定式、动名词或从句等来充当。例
1) He took his bag and left.(名词)他拿着书包离开。
2) Li Lei always helps me when I have difficulties.(代词)当我遇到困难时,李雷总能给我帮助。
3) She plans to travel in the coming May day.(不定式)她打算在即将到来的“五一”外出旅游。
4) I don 't know what should do next.(从句)我不知道下一步该干什么。
注意:英语中的许多动词既是及物动词,又是不及物动词

四、句型4: Subject(主语) + verb(谓语) + Indirect object(间接宾语) + Direct object(直接宾语)
这种句型中,直接宾语为主要宾语,表示动作是对谁做的或为谁做的,在句中不可或缺,常常由表示“物”的名词来充当;
间接宾语也被称之为第二宾语,去掉之后,对整个句子的影响不大，多由指“人”的名词或代词承担。引导这
类双宾语的常见动词有:buy,pass,lend,give,tel, teach,show, bring,send等,如:
1)Her father bought her a dictionary as a birthday present.蛐岫爸爸给她买了一本词典作为生日礼物。
2)The old man always tells the children stories about the heroes in the Long March.
老人经常给孩子们讲述长征途中那些英雄的故事。上述句子还可以表达为：
1)Her father bought a dictionary for her as a birthday present.
2)The old man always tells stories about the heroes to the children in the Long March.

五、句型5: Subject(主语) + verb(动词) + object(宾语) + Complement(补语)
这种句型中的“宾语 + 补语"统称为“复合宾语”。宾语补足语的主要作用或者是补充、说明宾语的特点、身份等;或
者表示让宾语去完成的动作等。担任补语的常常是名词、形容词、副词、介词短语、分词、动词不定式等。如:
1) You should keep the room clean and tidy. 迩应该让屋子保持干净整洁。(形容词)
2) We made him our monitor. (名词)我们选他当班长。
3) His father told him not to play in the street. (不定式)他父亲告诉他不要在街上玩。

1)The boss made him do the work all day. 老板让他整天做那项工作.
2) I heard her sing in the next room all the time last night. 昨晚上我听见她在隔壁唱了一个晚上.


英语语法口诀13条:
1、英语的词类
句子要由词组成,英语词类有十种:句中成分用实词,名、代、动、副、数、
形容:冠、介、连词和感叹,虚词附加或沟通。词类功能掌握了,造句之时好运用。

2、语序歌
主、谓、宾、表同汉语,定语有同也有异。状语位置更特殊,不能全和汉语比。

3、肯定句变一般疑问句
have和be提句首,其它助词Do开头。时间、人称由do变,动词只把原形留。谓语助词有几个,第一助词提句首。

4、肯定句变否定句
否定词语加not.放在be和have后。其它要加动词do,do的后面加not，
时间、人称由do变,动词原形总保留。谓语若是助词多,not紧跟第一个。

5、名词的所有格
名词只变数,不分主宾格。人和动物类,可变所有格。撇(')后加s,相当汉语“的”。时间、距离等,也变所有格。

6、名词变复数
单数变为复数式,加上“s"统言之。下列结尾名词后,要加“s”先加"e":发音
[t][j][s]和[z],或是辅音加“o"时。有些名词变复数,词尾变化要注意:“y"前
字母是辅音,一律变"y"为"e”;遇到“fe°,有时需要变ve”少数名词不规则
特别情况靠硬记。

7、时问名词前所有介词的速记
年月周前要用in,日子前面却不行。遇到几号要用“on”,上午下午又是“in”。
要说某日上下午,用on换in才能行。午夜黄昏用at,黎明用它也不错。at
也在时分前,说“差”用to,说“过”要用past.

8、介词用法歌
介词加宾语,才能有实意。表、定、状、宾、补,词组在句里。

9、介词顺口溜
in 在...里,out在...外,在旁边的是beside,靠近的为by, on在上, under在...下, above在...上头, below在...底下。

10、be的用法歌
动词be,变化大,叩用"am"You"用“are”ls用于它(it)、他(he)、她(she)复数一定要用“are",切莫用错闹笑话。

11、动词的时态
四种时间各四式,联想对比便于记。时间现在和过去,各自还有将来时。
一般、完成、进行式,完成进行是四式。四四共有十六种,看来复杂掌握易;
除去have/be以外,动词变化有规律。

12、动词形式的变化
动词根本是原形,变化形式有四种:
原形词尾加“s”,现在第三单人称;
过去原形加"ed",过去分词也相同;
原形加上ing",现在分词或动名。
原形词尾加“s”,如同名词复数式。
若加ed/ing",以下情况要注意:词尾有ie只加d,lng去掉无声e;
词尾ie变成y,然后再加ing;
辅音之后y结尾,Y要变i加ed;
现在分词不变y,直接加上ing;
词尾重读闭音节,结尾辅音都双写,r做结尾也一样,重读音节r双写;
结尾字母若是“t",不是重读也双写。
过去分词过去式,不按规则也有些。

13、动词不定式不带to的动词
四看(notice, observe,see, watch),三使役(have,let,make),二听(hear, listen to)一感觉(feel)。

英语的时态
一般现在时:主语 + 动词原形第三人称单数
一般过去时:主语 + 动词的过去分词
一般将来时:主语 + shall/Will + 动词原形
过去将来时:主语 + should/would + 动词原形
现在进行时:主语 + (am,is,are) + 现在分词
过去进行时:主语 + (Was,Were) + 现在分词
过去将来时:主语 + should/would + be + 现在分词
完成进行时:主语 + had/has + been + 现在分词
过去将来进行时:主语 + should/would + be + 现在分词
过去将来完成进行时:主语 + should/Would + have + 过去分词
过去完成进行时:主语 + had + 过去分词
将来完成进行时:主语 + shall/will + 现在分词
过去将来完成进行时:主语 + should/would + have + been + 现在分词
现在完成时:主语 + have/has + 过去分词
过去完成时:主语 + had + 过去分词
将来完成时:主语 + shall/Will + have + 过去分词
常用的有8种:一般现在时 一般过去时 现在进行时 过去进行时
一般将来时 过去将来时 现在完成时 过去完成时

被动语态的用法
1.一般现在时的被动语态构成:is/am/are + 及物动词的过去分

编辑本段主动语态改被动语态
把主动语态改为被动语态非常简单,可以遵循以下几个步骤:
1.先找出谓语动词;
2.再找出谓语动词后的宾语;
3.把宾语用作被动语态中的主语;
4.注意人称、时态和数的变化。
例  1. Bruce writes a letter every week. → A letter is written by Bruce every week.
    2. Li Lei mended the broken bike this morning. →The broken bike was mended by Li lei this morning.
    3. He has written two novels so far.→ two novels have been written y him so far.
    4. They will plant ten trees tomorrow. →Ten trees will be planted by them tomorrow.
    5. Lucy is writing a letter now. →a letter is being written by Lucy now.
    6. You must lock the door when you leave.→ the door must be locked when you leave.

编辑本段使用被动语态的注意问题
1.不及物动词无被动语态。

The dinosaurs disappeared about 65 million years ago.

2.有些动词用主动形式表示被动意义
This pen writes well.
This new book sells well.

3.感官动词或使役动词使用省略to的动词不定式,主动语态中不带to,但变为被动语态时,须加上to.
例 make somebody do something. → somebody + be + made to do something
see somebody do something. → somebody + be + seen to do something
A girl saw my wallet drop when she passed by. → My wallet was seen to drop by a girl when she passed by.
he boss made the little boy do heavy work. → The little boy was made to do heavy work by the boss.
His mother gave him a present for his birthday. → He was given a present by his mother for his birthday.

4.如果是接双宾语的动词改为被动语态时,直接宾语(物)作主语,那么动词后要用介词,这个介词是由与其搭配的动词决定。
He gave me a book. → a book was given to me by him.
He showed me a ticket. → a ticket was shown to me by him.
My father bought me a new bike. → A new bike was bought for me by my father.

5.一些动词短语用于被动语态时,动词短语应当看作一个整体,而不能丢掉其中的介词或副词.
We can't laugh at him. → He can't be laughed at by us.
He listens to the radio every day. → The radio is listened to by him every day.
The nurse is taking care of the sick man. → the sick man is being taken care of by the nurse.

6.宾语补足语的被动语态
